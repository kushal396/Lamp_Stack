## Your zeroth approach below

Reasoning - I installed WSL by using the steps given in zeroth.c. And then I executed the file zeroth.c after fixing the error in it, which was changing datatype of the array from int to char. On exectuion it showed the message : "The answer of this challenge is output of "man" when run on the terminal, copy the exact output". So I ran man command and got the following output.

```
What manual page do you want?
For example, try 'man man'.
